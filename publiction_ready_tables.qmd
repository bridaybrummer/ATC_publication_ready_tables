## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r, setup}
#| echo: false

library(gtsummary)
library(flextable)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-trial
#| tbl-cap: The caption for this is specified in the code chunk

trial %>%tbl_summary(by = trt) %>%as_flex_table
```

Look at @tbl-trial.

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
